  <p>
    A staff illness policy or procedure helps you to:
  <ul>
    <li>Manage staff when they are sick and when they are safe to work. </li>
    <li>Reduce the risk of making other staff and customers sick. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    We recommend that you:
  <ul>
    <li>Create a staff illness policy or procedure.</li>
    <li>Give your policy or procedure to all staff. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    If the staff are from non-English-speaking backgrounds, the information should be 
    provided in the relevant languages (if possible).
